# alg-geo

The original author created this repository to share his notes and expositions on algebraic geometry more easily.
The flagship document is ``trinh_alg-geo,'' intended to cover the equivalent of Hartshorne Chapters II-III, while being more concise, being more transparently organized, and folding Hartshorne's exercises into the text.
At the same time, it is written more formally than the Stacks Project, while focusing on less material and making no effort to be self-contained.

Other documents in this repository will be considerably more informal : hence, more likely to contain errata.
